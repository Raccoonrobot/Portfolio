<h2>About Keri</h2>
<p>A little about me: <br>
    I'm Keri, a new coder and a seasoned smart ass. I'm a fixer of things. I enjoy creating. From wine to sewing projects and kitchen cabinets to saunas. 
    I believe most everything can be improved, be faster, and look better. I've been a lab tech and a vet tech, but the pull of coding has called with its promise
    of structure, rules with solutions and endless creative outlets.
